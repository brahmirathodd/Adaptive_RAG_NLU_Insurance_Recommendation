## ðŸ“– Purpose

These brochures serve as reference materials for the Adaptive RAG system, allowing it to:

* Provide accurate and detailed policy information to users.
* Recommend policies based on users' insurance needs.
* Leverage official LIC data to ensure reliable responses.

## ðŸŒŸ Future Scope

Currently, we have integrated LIC policies due to the accessibility of reliable data. However, the system is designed to expand its offerings in the future by incorporating insurance products from other providers. This will enable broader policy recommendations and enhance the personalization of user suggestions.
